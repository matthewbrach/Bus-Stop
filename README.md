# Bus Stop
 Real time bus information for Boston MBTA

![Bus Stop](Busroute.png)

Static web pages can be boring, they are informative but struggle at times to keep relevant. Using async functions and JSON, this software provides a continuing update of one of the local MBTA busses near the MIT campus. The code fetches the data, parses it and then updates a marker on the map every second. 



 Future improvements could include tracking multiple busses, calculating the average speed, logging the data determining average arrival and departure times.

To run this software - download the files and save them into a folder. Using Visual Studio Code, or your preferred local web server, run index.html to see the program in action.
